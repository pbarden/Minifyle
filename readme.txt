This is a Java program created to remove whitespace from CSS files. In general this will help reduce the file size. As-is, no warranties. Only intended for use with files using the .css extension.

Instructions:
1. Run the JAR file
2. Drop in the file path
3. Done!

Your new file will show up in the same directory as the original as "[file_name]-min.css".
